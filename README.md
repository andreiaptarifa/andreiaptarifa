### Hi there, I'm Andreia 👋

I'm a software engineer from Brazil. Before changing my career to web development, I worked for 7 years in the Payments industry in Brazil - the last year as a Product Manager 💼 -, focused on providing accessible solutions for the unbanked population.

My programming languages are Ruby :heart: and JavaScript 💛. Currently, I’m honing my skills in React ⚛️.

I thrive in dynamic environments that foster innovation and collaboration, and I'm always seeking new opportunities to contribute to projects that make a difference.

**Languages**: Ruby, JavaScript, SQL
**Frameworks**: Rails, Sinatra, React
**DB**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite
**Interests**: Behavioural Economics, Neuroscience, Languages, Jazz, Prog Rock
